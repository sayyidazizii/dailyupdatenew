# 🤖 Smart Daily Update Bot

Automated commit bot that maintains natural GitHub activity with intelligent randomization.

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Frequency**: 8-15 random commits per day
- **Dynamic Messages**: 20+ varied commit messages  
- **Natural Activity**: Simulates real development work
- **Intelligent Tracking**: Prevents spam and maintains realistic patterns
- **Timezone Aware**: All timestamps in WIB (Asia/Jakarta)

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Workflow runs** every ~30-60 minutes during active hours (06:00-23:00 WIB)
2. **Bot decides** randomly whether to commit based on daily target (8-15 commits)
3. **Adds realistic activity** to `daily_update.txt` with varied descriptions
4. **Uses random commit messages** from a curated list
5. **Tracks progress** in `commit_tracking.json` to maintain natural frequency

## 📊 Activity Types

The bot simulates various development activities:
- Code review sessions
- Feature development  
- Bug fixing
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimization
- Testing improvements
- Refactoring work
- Security enhancements
- UI/UX improvements
- Database optimization
- API development
- Deployment preparation

## 🎯 Smart Logic

- Daily target randomized between 8-15 commits
- 70% probability to commit when target not reached
- Automatic date reset and counter tracking
- Natural time distribution throughout the day
- No double commits - clean git history

## 📈 Expected Results

- **Daily Frequency**: 8-15 commits per day (high activity)
- **Commit Rate**: ~30-55% of 27 workflow runs
- **GitHub Profile**: Consistent green squares with professional messages
- **Activity Logs**: Detailed development simulation in `daily_update.txt`

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Push to GitHub** - All files to your repository
2. **Enable Actions** - Go to Actions tab and enable workflows
3. **Manual Test** - Run workflow manually to verify setup
4. **Monitor** - Check Actions tab and commit history

## 📱 Monitoring

- **Actions Tab**: View workflow runs and success/failure rates
- **`daily_update.txt`**: Detailed activity logs with timestamps
- **`commit_tracking.json`**: Daily progress tracking
